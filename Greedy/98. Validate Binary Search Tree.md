**<h1>QUESTION : </h1>**
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A `valid BST` is defined as follows:

* The `left subtree` of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The `right subtree` of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**<h2>Example 1 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [2,1,3]

**Output**: true

**<h2>Example 2 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]

**Output**: false

**<h2>Explanation :</h2>**  The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

**<h2>Constraints :</h2>**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].

-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

**<h2>Explanation :</h2>**
The idea is truely Simple we have to keep in mind the property of the BST same as the left node being smaller than root and on the other hand root being smaller than the right node so that makes the limit of comparison for any root as follows:-
The Leaf nodes as they don't have any left or right so we are comparing them with positive and negative infinity
any root node except leaves will have the lower limit as left and higher limit as right.
And here only the problem gets sorted tada!!

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
       return isValidBST(root,-Long.MAX_VALUE,Long.MAX_VALUE);
    }
    boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root,long min , long max){
        if(root==null)return true;
        if(root.val>=max || root.val<=min)return false;
        return isValidBST(root.left,min,root.val) && isValidBST(root.right,root.val,max);
    }
}
```
