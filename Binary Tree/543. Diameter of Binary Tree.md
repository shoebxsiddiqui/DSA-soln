**<h1>QUESTION : </h1>**
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

> The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
**<h2>Example 1 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [1,2,3,4,5]

**Output**: 3

**Explanation**: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**<h2>Example 2 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [1,2]

**Output**: 1

**<h2>Constraints :</h2>**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100

**<h2>Explanation :</h2>**
The basic intuition is to find the max height of left and right of the node and sum them. The node with maximum value of this is the answer.

`ans` stores the sum of max height of left and right subtrees and we are returning the maximum height.

```java
class Solution {
    int ans = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return ans;
    }
    int helper(TreeNode root) {
        if ( root == null )
            return 0;
        
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        
        ans = Math.max(ans, left+right);
        return Math.max(left,right)+1;
    }
}
```
