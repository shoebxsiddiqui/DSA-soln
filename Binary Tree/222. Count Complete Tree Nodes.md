**<h1>QUESTION : </h1>**
Given the root of a `complete binary tree`, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

**<h2>Example 1 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

**Output**: 6

**<h2>Example 2 :</h2>**

**Input:**  []

**Output**: 1

**<h2>Example 3 :</h2>**

**Input:**  [1]

**Output**: 1

**<h2>Constraints :</h2>**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].

0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104

The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

**<h2>Explanation :</h2>**
**Approach**: 
* It was easy until they have mentioned to solve it in less then O(N) time complexity.
* As we can't traverse every node so we gonna find the height of the left and right subtree and if they came out to be equal we gonna use the formula of complete binary tree "nodes=2^h - 1".
* if lh and rh are not equal we will add the values of all the node in the left and al the nodes in the right + 1.

```java
// O((logN)^2)
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        int lh=heightleft(root);
        int rh=heightright(root);
        
        if(lh==rh)
            return (int)Math.pow(2, lh)-1;
        else return countNodes(root.left)+countNodes(root.right)+1;
    }
    int heightleft(TreeNode root) {
        int c=0;
        while(root != null) {
            c++;
            root=root.left;
        }
        return c;
    }
    int heightright(TreeNode root) {
        int c=0;
        while(root != null) {
            c++;
            root=root.right;
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```
