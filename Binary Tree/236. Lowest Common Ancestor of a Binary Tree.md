**<h1>QUESTION : </h1>**
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**<h2>Example 1 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

**Output**: 3

**<h2>Example 2 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

**Output**: 5

**<h2>Example 3 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2

**Output**: 1

**<h2>Constraints :</h2>**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].

-109 <= Node.val <= 109

All Node.val are unique.

p != q

p and q will exist in the tree.

**<h2>Explanation :</h2>**
recursive traversal. return the node that is not null.

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if ( root == null )
            return null;
        
        if ( p == root || q== root )
            return root;
        
        TreeNode lh = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode rh = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        
        if ( lh == null )
            return rh;
        else if ( rh == null )
            return lh;
        else return root;
        
    }
}
