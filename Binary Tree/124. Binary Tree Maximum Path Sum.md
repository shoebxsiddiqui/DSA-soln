**<h1>QUESTION : </h1>**
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

> The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
**<h2>Example 1 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [1,2,3]

**Output**: 6

**Explanation**: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

**<h2>Example 2 :</h2>**

**Input:**  root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

**Output**: 42

**Explanation**: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
**<h2>Constraints :</h2>**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

**<h2>Explanation :</h2>**
We have to apply `val + (maxL+maxR)` on every node and have to return the maximum value of it.

The intuition is same like we we were doing in maximum width problem. 

The difference is the we have to add nodes value in the sum and in return statement we have to replace 1 with nodes value.

```java
class Solution {
    int sum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return sum;
    }
    int helper(TreeNode root) {
        if ( root == null ) 
            return 0;
        
        int ml = Math.max(0,helper(root.left));
        int mr = Math.max(0,helper(root.right));
        
        sum = Math.max(sum, ml+mr+root.val);
        return root.val + Math.max(ml,mr);
    }
}
```
