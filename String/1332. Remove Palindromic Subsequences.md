**<h1>QUESTION : </h1>**
You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

**<h2>Example 1 :</h2>**

**Input:**  s = "ababa"

**Output**: 1

**Explanation**: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.

**<h2>Example 2 :</h2>**

**Input:**  s = "abb"

**Output**: 2

**Explanation**: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".

**<h2>Example 3 :</h2>**

**Input:**  s = "baabb"

**Output**: 2

**Explanation**: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".

**<h2>Constraints :</h2>**
1 <= s.length <= 1000

s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'

**<h2>Explanation :</h2>**
* If string is empty, retrun 0
* if reverse is equal to string then return 1
* return 2

```java
class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        if(s == "")
            return 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        if(s.equals(sb.reverse().toString()))
            return 1;
        return 2;
    }
}

```
