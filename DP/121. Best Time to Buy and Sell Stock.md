**<h1>QUESTION : </h1>**
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a `single day` to buy one stock and choosing a `different day` in the future to sell that stock.

Return the `maximum profit` you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

**<h2>Example 1 :</h2>**

**Input:**  prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

**Output**: 5

**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**<h2>Example 2 :</h2>**

**Input:**  prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

**Output**: 0

**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0

**<h2>Constraints :</h2>**
1 <= prices.length <= 10^5

0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

```java
{
        int lsf = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // least so far
        int op = 0; // overall profit
        int pist = 0; // profit if sold today
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] < lsf){ // if we found new buy value which is more smaller then previous one
                lsf = prices[i]; // update our least so far
            }
            pist = prices[i] - lsf; // calculating profit if sold today by, Buy - sell
            if(op < pist){ // if pist is more then our previous overall profit
                op = pist; // update overall profit
            }
        }
        return op; // return op 
```
